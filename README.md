# System Overview

![StructureMap](https://github.com/ETC-2020-Fall-XRoom/XRoom/blob/main/Documents/StructureMap.PNG)

<center> Structure Map</center>

The main system logic is as follow:

1. Players scan QRcode to place virtual space scene prefab
2. Clients send self relative position information back to server for synchronization
3. Server calculates ray behavior, player status information
4. Server send relative calculated position and rotation information back to client
5. Clients retrieve calculated relative transform data and set virtual objects in local world accordingly
6. Back to step2

# Deploy game server on AdvantEdge

### What you need to do before the deployment:

1. install AdvantEdge Edge Computing platform from here:
   https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/AdvantEDGE/wiki
2. Download the dockerize.sh, scenario.yaml, Dockerfile, commands.sh from Edge File folder.
3. Build your game server in linux(with the server build on) and replace your game's name in commands.sh.
4. Copy the dockerize.sh, scenario.yaml, Dockerfile, commands.sh to your server build folder.

### How to deploy the game

1. Run the AdvantEdge and import the scenario.yaml to through the platform dashboard.
2. Replace the ip address to your own in dockerize.sh
3. Running the following command in your game server build directory:
   ./dockerize.sh
4. Build a new sandbox and deploy the edge platform.
5. Now the server should be running.
